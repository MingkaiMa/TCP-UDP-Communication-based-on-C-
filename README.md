# TCP-UDP-Communication-based-on- C Sharp
This project implements UDP,TCP client/server model

TCPclient.exe can communicate with TCPserver.exe, UDPclient can connect to UDPserver.exe. 

I had not add critical codes to realize the security function, but indeed, I got deeply understand about network and security.
